# Need to have an instance of selenium running... i.e:
# java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar

# Current code set up is using a Safari driver for selenium.
# This will definitely change to chrome when I dockerize this.


# TODO: Enhance this script to check and be sure this selenium instance is running.

go run main.go
